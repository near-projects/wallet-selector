This project is using an [NX](https://nx.dev) style [monorepository](https://monorepo.tools) that helps divide and map the project dependencies for each project.

The core modules are in the `packages` directory and the example apps are in the `examples` directory. In order to figure out the commands you need to run, you can use the `nx` command line tool.

> You can also use the infix notation to run a target:
 nx [target] [project] [options, ...]

On the other hand, if you want to run a specific command in a package, you can use the `nx run` command. There are a lot of things defined in every project's `project.json` file:

To run a target:    
```bash
yarn nx run [project][:target][:configuration] [options, ...]
yarn nx r [project][:target][:configuration] [options, ...]
```

In order to run a specific example, make sure you build the UI library beforehand and on each modification by running:

```bash
yarn nx run near-wallet-selector:build #build the library

yarn nx serve react # to run the react example
yarn nx serve angular # to run the angular example
```
